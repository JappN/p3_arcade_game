###Project 3 Arcade Game - Udacity Nanodegree

Welcome to my zombie game!

The goal of the game is to move Ricky across the bloody road successfully, without running in to any of those nasty child zombies.

* Download the files into your computer to play it offline, or play it online.

* Open the index.html file in your favorite browser.

* Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move in any direction on the screen.

* Once you reach the park on top, you are safe! If you run in to a zombie, the game will restart.

** Have fun! **

I donâ€™t own Ricky. Ricky of The Walking Dead is the property of AMC, and are not my intellectual property. There is no financial gain made from this nor will any be sought. This is for educational purposes only.


Learning how to code for this project was a challenge, since I have no JS experience, but thanks to the fellow Udacity students, friends and several hours researching books, stackoverflow and the internet, I was able to build the required file, hopefully without many mistakes. Thanks.
